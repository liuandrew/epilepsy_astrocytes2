strength of facilitation of calcium response when axis is flipped to positive rates
or with negative - depression of calcium response


to determine if noise is a viable level
bin in time calcium response means
find standard deviation of means of calcium trace
    you know standard deviation of phi - you should see what standard deviation of calcium this results in and that should be knowable experimentally
